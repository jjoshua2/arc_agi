[SYSTEM]
You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs). Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.

The inputs and outputs are each "grids". A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as both images and grids of numbers (ASCII). You may also get an ASCII representation of the change for each cell comparing the input and output. For example 0 -> 1 means the value switched from 0 to 1 in that cell. `--` means the value in that cell did not change. The image and the grid of numbers for each input/output contain the same information: we just show both representations for convenience. Each number corresponds to a color in the image. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.

The transformation rule maps from each input to a single correct output, and your implementation in code must be exactly correct. Thus, you need to resolve all potential uncertainties you might have about the transformation rule. For instance, if the examples always involve some particular color being changed to another color in the output, but which color it is changed to varies between different examples, then you need to figure out what determines the correct output color. As another example, if some shape(s) or cells in the input are relocated or recolored, you need to determine which exact shapes should be relocated/recolored in the output and where they should be moved or what their color in the output should be. Whenever there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in your current understanding of the transformation rule, you need to resolve them before implementing the transformation in code. You should resolve ambiguities and uncertainties by carefully analyzing the examples and using step by step reasoning.

The transformation rule might have multiple components and might be fairly complex. It's also reasonably common that the transformation rule has one main rule (e.g., replace cells in XYZ pattern with color ABC), but has some sort of exception (e.g., don't replace cells if they have color DEF). So, you should be on the lookout for additional parts or exceptions that you might have missed so far. Consider explicitly asking yourself (in writing): "Are there any additional parts or exceptions to the transformation rule that I might have missed?" (Rules don't necessarily have multiple components or exceptions, but it's common enough that you should consider it.)

Here are some examples of transformation rules with multiple components or exceptions:

- There is a grey grid with black holes that have different shapes and the rule is to fill in these holes with colored cells. Further, the color to use for each hole depends on the size of the hole (in terms of the number of connected cells). 1 cell holes are filled with pink, 2 cell holes are filled with blue, and 3 cell holes are filled with red.
- The output is 3x3 while the input is 3x7. The output has red cells while the input has two "sub-grids" that are 3x3 and separated by a grey line in the middle. Each of the sub-grids has some colored cells (blue) and some black cells. The rule is to AND the two sub-grids together (i.e., take the intersection of where the two sub-grids are blue) and color the 3x3 cells in the output red if they are in the intersection and black otherwise.
- The grey rectangular outlines are filled with some color in the output. Pink, orange, and purple are used to fill in the voids in different cases. The color depends on the size of the black void inside the grey outline where it is pink if the void has 1 cell (1x1 void), orange if the gap has 4 cells, and purple if the gap was 9 cells. For each void, all of the filled-in colors are the same.
- The red shape in the input is moved. It is moved either horizontally or vertically. It is moved until moving it further would intersect with a purple shape. It is moved in the direction of the purple shape, that is, moved in whichever direction would involve it eventually intersecting with this purple shape.

These are just example rules; the actual transformation rule will be quite different. But, this should hopefully give you some sense of what transformation rules might look like.

Note that in each of these cases, you would need to find the rule by carefully examining the examples and using reasoning. You would then need to implement the transformation rule precisely, taking into account all possible cases and getting all of the details right (e.g., exactly where to place various things or exactly which color to use in each case). If the details aren't fully ironed out, you should do additional reasoning to do so before implementing the transformation in code.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.

After your reasoning, write code in triple backticks (```python and then ```).
You should write a function called `transform` which takes a single argument, the input grid as `list[list[int]]`, and returns the transformed grid (also as `list[list[int]]`).
Your python code should not use libraries outside of the standard python libraries besides numpy.You can create helper functions.
You should make sure that you implement a version of the transformation which works in general (for inputs which have the same properties as the example inputs and the additional input(s)).
Don't write tests in your python code, just output the `transform` function.

<reasoning>
The outputs don't have the same shape as the inputs, and they don't appear to be somewhat edited copies of the input.

The inputs appear to consist of "noisy" segments which are either stacked on top of each other or side-by-side. In other words, they are either noisy columns or noisy rows. Each segment consists of exactly one color. These colors also appear in the output.

In two of the example inputs (inputs 2 and 3), there are horizontal segments (rows) which are stacked on top of each other. The outputs for these inputs are each single columns. The color of each cell in the output column is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the other example input (input 1), there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. The output for this input is a single row. The color of each cell in the output row is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the additional input, there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. This input matches the "noisy" segment pattern of the other inputs.

The transformation rule appears to be to identify the colors of the segments and then to stack them side-by-side if they are columns or on top of each other if they are rows.

My code will first need to determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments. Then, it will need to identify the colors of the segments and stack them side-by-side or on top of each other as appropriate.

How can I determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments? Inputs which consist of column segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal column of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the leftmost (or rightmost) column. Otherwise, the leftmost (or rightmost) segment wouldn't be contiguous. Similarly, inputs which consist of row segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal row of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the topmost (or bottommost) row.

So, to identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments, I can check if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color. If they do, then the input consists of column segments. Otherwise, the input consists of row segments.

I need to know the colors of the segments (in order). I know that the segments are contiguous. So, I can take any row/column which includes all of the segments and then deduplicate the colors in that row/column. The resulting list of colors will be the colors of the segments (in order). If the input consists of column segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of column segments, I want to look at any row. I'll use the top row. If the input consists of row segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of row segments, I want to look at any column. I'll use the left column.

I'll use numpy in the code to make it easier to work with the grid.

The code should:

- Identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments. This can be done by checking if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color.
- Identify the colors of the segments (in order). This can be done by looking at the top row if the input consists of column segments and by looking at the left column if the input consists of row segments.
- If the input is columns, return a single row where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment. If the input is rows, return a single column where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment.

I'll now write the code.
</reasoning>

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(grid_lst: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    grid = np.array(grid_lst)

    left_column = grid[:, 0]
    top_row = grid[0, :]

    is_columns = np.all(left_column == left_column[0])

    intersecting_item = top_row if is_columns else left_column

    out_in_order = list(dict.fromkeys(intersecting_item))

    if is_columns:
        return [out_in_order]
    else:
        return [[x] for x in out_in_order]
```

                    Here is a primitive that you can build upon to solve this problem. Remember, it's okay to not to use this primitive too
                    if you think it's not helpful.

                    import numpy as np

def transform(grid_lst: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    grid = np.array(grid_lst)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    
    # The output will have the same number of rows but only 4 columns
    output = np.zeros((rows, 4), dtype=int)
    
    # Copy the first 4 columns as they are
    output[:, :4] = grid[:, :4]
    
    # For each cell to the right of the grey column (column 4), reflect it to the left
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(5, cols):  # Columns 5 to 8 (0-indexed)
            if grid[r, c] != 0:  # Only reflect non-zero values
                # Calculate mirror position: mirror_col = 3 - (c - 5)
                mirror_col = 3 - (c - 5)
                output[r, mirror_col] = grid[r, c]
    
    return output.tolist()
